As soon as it realises it is dealing with a digital stomp pedal, it resets the
analog value to its rest state (so only Pedal (Sustain) is asserted).
        For analog, the rest state (in MIDI) is 7F (in all modes)
        For digital, the rest state (in MIDI) is 00, and active state is 7F

Analog range: 220 - 7500/inf
Digital range: 0 - 4.7 (it's basically looking for a short)

When switching to a new type of analog pedal, it does _not_ reset the value of
the old analog pedal.

Byte 14 is the pedal!
        00 - 7F         analog (7F is rest state)
        FF              digital stomp (or high bit is stomp, low bits indicate
                        analog rest state)

Byte 20 seems to be
        00      if byte 14 == 7F
        01      if byte 14 == FF (digital stomp)
        02      if 00 < byte 14 < 7F
        03      if byte 14 == 00

Except that if the keyboard is disconnected, bytes 14 and 20 are both 00 (as is
byte 25 - although this can become 00 anyway).
